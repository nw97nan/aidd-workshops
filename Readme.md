# Digital Chemistry: AI in Drug Discovery - Workshop
This repository contains the code and instructions for setting up for the AI in Drug Discovery workshop sessions.

## Contents
During the workshop, we will be using a framework for machine learning in drug discovery called [DeepChem](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem). DeepChem is a Python library and toolchain that combines multiple machine learning algorithms, frameworks and datasets and provides a unified interface for training and evaluating models in drug discovery.

For each workshop session, we will be practically using DeepChem through a set of tutorial [Jupyter Notebooks](https://ipython.org/notebook.html) from the [DeepChem library](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/tree/master/examples/tutorials).

### Workshop 1: Introduction to DeepChem (07/03/2024)

This workshop will introduce you to the basics of DeepChem and will allow you to familiarize yourself with the library.
